# 💻 Lab 6 - Add a Node CLI

###### ⏰ Estimated time: 10-15 minutes
<br />

Now let's make a node CLI that will use the api we created to access our games.
We'll make another `@nrwl/node` application, but this time invoke it as a script, instead of serving it as a long running task.
<br /><br />

## 📚 Learning outcomes:

- **Create a node CLI**
<br /><br /><br />

## 📲 After this workshop, you should have:

</details>
<br />

## 🏋️‍♀️ Steps:

1. **Stop any running `nx serve` instance**
   <br /><br />
2. **Generate a new Node app**, called `cli`
   <br /><br />
3. **Update the [main.ts](../../examples/lab6/apps/cli/src/main.ts)** file to call the api
   <br /><br />
4. Let's now **inspect the project graph**!
   <br /><br />
5. **Inspect what changed** from the last time you committed, then **commit your changes**\
   <br /><br />
