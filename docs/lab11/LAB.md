# üíé Lab 11 - Setting up CI

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

<br />

## üìö Learning outcomes:

- Basics of GitHub actions
- Use Nx to setup scalable checks on your PRs to ensure only passing code goes into the `main` branch
- Explore other practical uses of `nx affected`

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps :

Before starting on this lab, you must have a version of your local workshop
pushed to your GitHub repo.

1.  Let's make sure the main branch is up to date (it's important your latest changes are on `main` (or `master`) for the follow-up steps):

    - If you already are on `main` commit everything: `git add . && git commit -m "finished lab 14" git push origin main`
    - If you are on a different branch, commit everything, switch to the `main`, and bring it up to date:

      ```
      git add . && git commit "finish lab 14"
      git checkout main (or master)
      git merge previous-branch-you-were-on
      git push origin main (or master)
      ```

       <br />

2.  Create a new file `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

    ```yml
    name: Run CI checks # The name will show up on the GitHub Actions dashboard

    on: [pull_request] # This workflow will run only on Pull Requests

    jobs:
      test-cli: # give our job an ID
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest # the image our job will run on
        name: Test CLI # the name that will appear on the Actions UI
        steps: # what steps it will perform
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # checkout whatever branch the PR is using
            with:
              fetch-depth: 0
          - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1 # trigger an `npm install`
          - run: npx nx test cli # test the "cli" project
      test-api:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: Test API
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              fetch-depth: 0
          - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
          - run: npx nx test api
    ```

    <br /> <br />

3.  Commit and then switch to a new branch:

    ```
    git add . && git commit -m "add ci"
    git push origin main (or main)
    git checkout -b dynamic-title
    ```

    ‚ö†Ô∏è I know we **just** switched to main above. But it was important we bring it
    up to date. Now we need to switch to a new branch so we can submit our PR.
    <br /> <br />

4.  Open `apps/cli/src/main.ts`
    <br /> <br />

5.  And add a console log to output a message

    ```
    console.log('This is a new message!')
    ```

    <br /> <br />

6.  Commit all your changes and push your new branch.
    <br /> <br />
7.  Go to GitHub and make a Pull Request to `main`
    <br /> <br />
8.  After a few moments you'll see something like this:
    ![GitHub Actions example](./github_actions.png)
    <br /> <br />
9.  The unit tests will be failing - that's expected.
    <br /> <br />

We are starting to set-up our CI, that will verify our Pull Requests to ensure bad code
doesn't go into `main`.

But now we're testing both projects - even though we only changed the cli.

---

### Testing only affected

10. Let's use `nx affected` to only test the changed projects:

    Instead of running two `nx` commands in your CI, run a single `nx affected` command
    that tests all affected projects.

    Refer to the [docs](https://nx.dev/nx/affected#affected)
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>üê≥ Hint 2</summary>

    Since it's a Pull Request, your base commit will always be `--base=origin/main`
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>üê≥ Hint 3</summary>

    You should only need 1 job now:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: Testing affected apps
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              fetch-depth: 0
          - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
          - run: .....
    ```

    </details>

    ‚ö†Ô∏è It's okay to work on this on your new branch. We'll merge everything to `main`
    eventually.
    <br /> <br />

11. Commit and push. On your Github Actions log you should see only the `cli` tests running.
    <br />

12. Our tests are now being run sequentially for each project. See if you can run them in parallel (consult the Nx Affected [docs](https://nx.dev/nx/affected#affected) if unsure)
    <br /> <br />

13. Our CI only does testing now. But we also have targets for `lint`, `e2e` and `build`. Would really be handy if CI also told us if any of those failed.

    **Add more steps under your CI workflow that run affected for each of the above targets**
    <br /> <br />

14. Commit and push your `ci.yml` changes.
    <br /> <br />
15. You'll notice some new steps in the GitHub Actions UI. Some of them are failing. That is okay. We can fix them later.
    <br /> <br />
16. For now, you can merge your PR into `main `
    <br /> <br />
17. Switch to `main` locally and pull latest so all your new CI changes are up to date.

    ```shell
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

    <br /> <br />

18. **BONUS:** Currently, if we create a PR with a change **only** to our `ci.yml` file, our `nx affected` commands won't run at all: as they'll think no project has been affected:

    <img src="./no_affected.png" width="500" alt="Changes to ci.yml does not cause anything to be affected">

    To be safe, we'd like to mark all projects as affected whenever we change our CI config, as we don't know what those changes could have broken.
    Have a look through the docs in the hint and see if you can do this.
